# Hello-World

My name is Michael Rafferty, I am 35years old and am just now, officially, starting my journey to become a Software Developer. I am professionally trained as a Journeyman Electrician working in the commercial and industrial field for 13years, 7 of which as a licensed Electrical Contractor. I am a self motivated individual, skilled in problem solving, adaptation as well as research and application. Additionally I have years of experience managing individuals and teams to achieve multi-faceted and complex projects. 

I have always had a passion for Computers and Technology, even when my previous career wasn't focus as much on the cutting edge of the tech industry, regardless, I had always stayed focused on the evolution of the Computer Sciences and their application to our daily lives, both personally and business. I look forward to adding my touch to this industry and one day I know that i'll be a contributing member of the developemental community.

Sincerely,
Michael Rafferty
